To get started, we will load in all of the R packages required to build our Linear Discriminant Analysis model.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dbplyr)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(parsnip)\nlibrary(discrim)\n\n\n\nGet Data\nNext, we will load the data in from the palmer penguins data set. Then, we randomly split the data into test and training sets so that we can get a more accurate estimate of its performance on unseen data and avoid overfitting.\n\n\nCode\ndf &lt;- palmerpenguins::penguins\nhead(df)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 8\n  species island    bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g\n  &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;fct&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;int&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n1 Adelie  Torgersen           39.1          18.7               181        3750\n2 Adelie  Torgersen           39.5          17.4               186        3800\n3 Adelie  Torgersen           40.3          18                 195        3250\n4 Adelie  Torgersen           NA            NA                  NA          NA\n5 Adelie  Torgersen           36.7          19.3               193        3450\n6 Adelie  Torgersen           39.3          20.6               190        3650\n# ℹ 2 more variables: sex &lt;fct&gt;, year &lt;int&gt;\n\n\nCode\nset.seed(65)\npenguins_split &lt;- initial_split(df, prop = 0.80, strata = species)\npenguins_train &lt;- training(penguins_split)\npenguins_test &lt;- testing(penguins_split)\n\n\n\n\nDefine and Fit Model\nNow that we have loaded in and divided the data, we can create and fit an LDA model.\n\n\nCode\n# Create the specification\nlda_spec &lt;- discrim_linear(mode = \"classification\", engine = \"MASS\")\n\n# Fit the model on the training data\nlda_fit &lt;- lda_spec %&gt;%\n  fit(species ~ bill_depth_mm + flipper_length_mm + body_mass_g, data = penguins_train)\n\n\nLinear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a classification technique used in machine learning and statistics to find a linear combination of features that characterizes or separates two or more classes of objects or events. It reduces dimensions while preserving as much of the class discriminatory information as possible, and is commonly used for pattern recognition, dimensionality reduction, and informative feature extraction. LDA works by maximizing the ratio of between-class variance to within-class variance, ensuring that the classes are as distinct as possible in the resulting projection.\nIn this case, LDA is probably overkill, since we are trying to predict a penguin’s species using just a few parameters. Let’s see how it did!\n\n\nModel Evaluation and Comparison\nFinally, we can test how well the model does with new/unseen data. This allows us to evaluate the model’s effectiveness.\n\n\nCode\naugment(lda_fit, new_data = penguins_test) %&gt;%\n  accuracy(truth = species, estimate = .pred_class)\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  .metric  .estimator .estimate\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 accuracy multiclass       0.7\n\n\nOur LDA model predicts a penguin’s species with 77% accuracy. To get an idea of how “good” this accuracy is, we can compare it to the accuracy of other possible models.\nThe following code fits and finds the accuracy of a logistic classification model.\n\n\nCode\nlm_spec &lt;- logistic_reg(mode = \"classification\", engine = \"glm\")\n\nlm_fit &lt;- lm_spec %&gt;% fit(species ~ bill_depth_mm + flipper_length_mm + body_mass_g, data = penguins_train)\n\naugment(lm_fit, new_data = penguins_test) %&gt;% accuracy(truth = species, estimate = .pred_class)\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  .metric  .estimator .estimate\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 accuracy multiclass     0.386\n\n\nThe accuracy for a simple logistic regression is around 38%, which is significantly worse than the accuracy for our LDA model. Seems like the LDA model is doing a pretty good job! In the future, it might be worth experimenting with other types of classification models like KNN or QDA to see if we can get better results. For now, though, we can stick with the LDA model’s 77% accuracy."

    "text": "There are three species of penguins in the Palmer Penguins data set.\n\nAdélie Penguins\n\n\n\nAn image of an Adélie penguin\n\n\nAdélie penguins are a distinctive and highly recognizable species of penguin known for their tuxedo-like black and white plumage and bright white rings around their eyes. These mid-sized penguins are named after Adélie Land, a part of Antarctica, and are one of the southernmost breeding birds in the world. They are about 46 to 71 centimeters (18 to 28 inches) in height and weigh between 3 to 6 kilograms (6.6 to 13.2 pounds).\nAdélie penguins are exclusively found along the Antarctic coast and on its surrounding islands. They are highly adapted to life in the water, with a diet primarily consisting of krill, though they also eat fish and squid. On land, they are known for their waddling gait and amusing antics, which include sliding on their bellies across the ice.\nDuring the breeding season, which starts in October, Adélie penguins return to the same nesting sites each year. They build simple nests from stones and exhibit strong fidelity to their mates. The harsh Antarctic environment necessitates considerable cooperation between the male and female, especially in incubating eggs and feeding the chicks.\nAdélie penguins play a crucial role in the Antarctic ecosystem and are considered an indicator species, with changes in their populations helping scientists track the impacts of climate change and other environmental factors on the region. Despite the extreme conditions of their habitat, they are among the most resilient and widely studied of all penguin species.\n\n\nChinstrap Penguins\n\n\n\nAn image of a Chinstrap penguin\n\n\nChinstrap penguins are easily identified by the narrow black band under their heads which looks like a helmet strap, giving them their common name. They are small to medium-sized penguins, typically weighing between 3 to 5 kilograms (6.6 to 11 pounds) and reaching about 68 to 76 centimeters (27 to 30 inches) in height.\nThese birds are primarily found on the islands and shores of the Southern Ocean and Antarctica. Chinstrap penguins are highly social creatures, known for their large, noisy colonies, sometimes numbering in the hundreds of thousands. These dense gatherings are not only a spectacle but also a survival strategy, helping protect individuals from predators and the harsh Antarctic elements.\nChinstrap penguins feed mainly on krill, though their diet also includes small fish and other crustaceans. They are excellent swimmers, using their strong flippers to propel themselves through water, often leaping through the air in short bursts to breathe.\nBreeding season for chinstrap penguins begins in November when they return to their rocky island breeding sites to reunite with their mates. They are monogamous during each breeding season and share the responsibilities of incubating their eggs and feeding their young. The nests are simple scrapes lined with stones.\nChinstrap penguins are known for their resilience and ability to thrive in one of the world’s most extreme environments. Their population trends are closely monitored by scientists as they can provide valuable insights into the health of the marine ecosystem and the effects of climate change on the polar regions.\n\n\nGentoo Penguins\n\n\n\nAn image of a Gentoo penguin\n\n\nGentoo penguins are distinguished by the striking white stripe that extends like a bonnet across the top of their heads, as well as their bright orange-red bills and peach-colored feet. They are the third-largest species of penguin, after the Emperor and King penguins, typically weighing between 4.5 and 8.5 kilograms (10 to 19 pounds) and standing about 76 to 81 centimeters (30 to 32 inches) tall.\nGentoos have a more northerly distribution than most other penguins, residing not only in Antarctica but also on many sub-Antarctic islands. They prefer rocky, ice-free areas for nesting, which makes them less dependent on sea ice for breeding compared to some other penguin species.\nTheir diet is quite diverse compared to other penguins; it includes fish, squid, and krill, which they hunt on swift and agile dives, sometimes reaching depths of over 170 meters (560 feet). Gentoos are known for their speedy swimming capabilities, reaching speeds of up to 36 kilometers per hour (22 miles per hour).\nBreeding season sees Gentoos forming large, noisy colonies. They are unique among penguins for laying two eggs of similar size during each breeding cycle. Both parents share the responsibilities of incubating the eggs and feeding the chicks in shifts. The nests are carefully built with stones, and disputes over stone theft among neighbors are common.\nGentoo populations are currently stable or increasing in some areas, but they remain under threat from environmental changes, particularly shifts in sea ice patterns and temperature which impact their feeding grounds. Like other penguins, Gentoos serve as important indicators of ocean health and the impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems."

One notable piece of information we get from this table is that bill length, flipper length, and body mass tend to be higher for males compared to females of the same species. Additionally, Gentoo penguins have a much higher average flipper length and body mass than the other two species.\n\n\nVisualize the Data\nTo get a better sense of the overlap between flipper lengths between the three species (as opposed to just comparing mean values), we can use side-by-side box plots.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df, aes(x = species, y = flipper_length_mm)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Comparison of Flipper Lengths\",\n       subtitle = \"By Species\",\n       x = \"Species\",\n       y = \"Flipper Length (mm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis visualization gives us information about the variance of each penguin species’ flipper length distribution, as well as the overlap in flipper lengths between species. While all three species have clearly different median flipper lengths, there is still a lot of overlap in penguins between the species, especially between Adelie and Chinstrap penguins.\nThe next chunk of code creates another side-by-side box plot, this time comparing body mass distributions across species.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df, aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Comparison of Body Mass\",\n       subtitle = \"By Species\",\n       x = \"Species\",\n       y = \"Body Mass (g)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGentoo penguins have a significantly higher body mass than the other two species, which are very close to each other both in median value and interquartile range. This might make it more difficult for our classification model to distinguish between Adelie and Gentoo penguins.\nFinally, to get an idea of how both flipper length and body mass are related across species, we can plot the relationship between these two measures on a scatter plot.\n\n\nCode\ndf %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n  labs(title = \"Body Mass vs. Bill Length\",\n     subtitle = \"By Species\",\n     x = \"Bill Length (mm)\",\n     y = \"Body Mass (g)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis scatterplot shows that penguins are roughly clustered by species when comparing their body mass and bill length. The added regression lines show that within each species, the relationship between bill length and body mass is pretty similar; penguins with longer bills tend to have a higher body mass regardless of the species."
